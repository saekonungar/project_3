for beta:
DREW
- implement timer as a displayobject and have the score logged somewhere
- make a savefile (updates whenever a puzzle is complete) read + write

BOTH:
- add more levels

ANYONE:
- have the score show up on the level selector as well as the level transition.
- also maybe have the level transition show what level you just cleared

EXTRA POLISH (do some but not necessarily all)
- make the level selection move smoothly from side to side
- have train turn red when the player goes into a corner, and have some kind of lives system or score penalty
- consider additional cosmetic features (background for puzzles, etc)
- also have level selection show highscore
- fix logs

DONE:

SKYE
- create a level menu
- implement level transitions
- experiment with the sizing of the screen and sprites
- put train tracks between level selection menu
- train rotate before game starts
- make the game pause for a second on a completed puzzle before pulling up the win menu
